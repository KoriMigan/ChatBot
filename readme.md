# Chat with PDF using Gemini

# ðŸ’¬ðŸ“„

This is a ChatBot integrated with a PDF text extraction feature, allowing for users to ask questions related to the uploaded PDF Documents. It leverages Google Generative AI models for conversational responses and FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient text similarity search.
